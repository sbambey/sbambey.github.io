                  <p class="card-text">Equipped with the experience from working at Rocket Lab on the propulsion team, I started leading the effort of building a portable liquid propellant test stand capable of supporting rocket engines producing in excess of 25kN of thrust.</p>
                  <p class="card-text">The test stand came together at record pace for a student team with only 6 months elapsing from idea to first hot fire. I was responsible for the overall design, and focused specifically on designing the liquid oxygen propellant feed system, the engine interface, hot fire procedures, and all data analysis for over 100 data channels. <strong>On July 13, 2019, UBC Rocket became the first Canadian student team to hot fire a liquid propellant rocket engine.</strong> To date, the test stand has supported three hot fire tests and remains in active use.</p>

                  <p class="card-text">To quantify the flow behaviour of our rocket engine injectors, I designed and built a water flow rig. This rig feeds water at a predetermined pressure from a large pressure vessel through our engine hardware and measures both the mass flow rate and pressure at the injector inlet. The flow rate measurement is taken using a Coriolis flow meter which measures mass flow directly and is very accurate.</p>
                  <p class="card-text">This flow rig has seen extensive use but is now being retired in favour of installing Coriolis flow meters directly on the rocket engine test stand. We found that measuring the flow behaviour with water was not consistenly scalable to the flow behaviour of other liquids as we would see during an actual engine hot fire.</p>

To qualify it, I led a test campaign of over 60 hot fire tests to become familiar with the igniter and to ensure it functions reliably. This test campaign led to several design changes and we ultimately gained the confidence to use this igniter design for our future engine tests.</p>
                  <p class="card-text">Since the igniter has been developed, it has been successfully used during all three engine tests completed to date.</p>

                  <p class="card-text">After having launched Cypress, I started leading early efforts to develop a suborbital, spacebound rocket powered by a liquid-propellant rocket engine. First, I led the development of a heat sink rocket engine.</p>
                  <p class="card-text">At the time I had not yet gained much experience with liquid propellant rocketry, so my time was spent reading the classic liquid propellant rocketry textbooks to learn the fundamentals. I co-designed the first engine and spent several hundred hours in the machine shop fabricating parts. I conducted hydrostatic leak checks and flow tests on the engine, and ultimately this would be the first engine we successfully hot fired two years later.</p>

The tracking software interfaces with the drone using a protocol called Mavlink and receives live telemetry. It then calculates a yaw and a pitch angle for the antenna and drives two stepper motors in the appropriate directions. Feedback on the actual position of the antenna is provided by an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) mounted to the antenna plate. 
                  <p class="card-text">Working with the IMU has been a challenge, as drift in the output persists to be an issue. In the future, I am planning to replace the IMU with a mechanical feedback that does not have the drift issues.</p>

                  <p class="card-text">As part of a class final project, I led team of three students that built a laser transceiver capable of transmission rates of up to 0.7kB/s, close to the theoretically determined limit for the hardware used. The project led to an invitation for presentation at <a href="http://iemcon.org/">IEMCON 2016</a>.</p>
                  <p class="card-text">In addition, I developed a custom communication protocal that makes use of the transceivers to permit transfer of text messages. This taught me a lot about how communication protocols are efficiently implemented and how error checking works. I combined the protocol with a chat server that a teammate developed which allowed us to demo a fully functional chat webapp that transferred messages via our transceiver across the classroom.</p>

The functionality includes a detailed sign up system which allows users to enter their qualifications such as flight hours, licenses, ratings and more. A comprehensive matching algorithmn I developed, then matches pilots with jobs they are eligible for. Furthermore, I created an extensive back-end for adding and updating jobs on the site.</p>
