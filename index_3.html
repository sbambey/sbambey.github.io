      <p>Since Sept 2017, I have been leading a team dubbed "Whistler-Blackcomb" as part of UBC Rocket. This team is the first step towards making our long term goal of sending a rocket to the edge of space become reality. The core technological challenge I identified is the propulsion system, hence it was the logical to start our efforts.</p>

      <p>Initially, I led the team through a high level design process. This process yielded core engine parameters such as thrust (12.5kN), burn duration, combustion chamber pressure and more. I considered manufacturing and timeline constraints which led me to make the decision to initially build a heatsink engine to qualify our feed system, engine injector and performance measures. A heatsink engine requires the engine material to soak up the large majority of the generated heat energy.</p>

      <p>The images seen above are of our first heatsink engine. It will provide sufficient thrust to power our rocket to over 100km in altitude (into space!). A large amount of the manufacturing work is being done by myself. The engine is made of solid steel bar, SCH160 steel pipe and 6061 aluminum. It is completely manufactured in house.</p>

      <p>In addition to the engine, I am leading the design and development of the feed system for the engine including tanks, valves, sensors and other plumbing components. The design is complete and currently going through final review and approval before components will be procured and the system assembled.</p>

      <p>We take our time to do things right, and safely, as a project of this caliber brings with it risks that need to be considered carefully. We are hopeful that a successful cold-flow qualification of the engine can occur this summer and that a hot fire will occur before the end of the year.</p>

      <p>In the summer of 2016, I founded the <a href="http://www.ubcrocket.com/" target="_blank">UBC Rocket</a> Engineering Design Team which designs, manufactures and launches sounding rockets. We compete yearly in the <a href="http://www.soundingrocket.org/2017-irec.html" target="_blank">Intercollegiate Rocket Engineering Competition</a>, also known as the Spaceport America Cup. The three-year goal of our team is to send a rocket above the Kármán line using a liquid-propellant rocket engine.</p>

      <p>Over the span of ten months we designed and built Cypress, our first rocket, with the goal of launching it to 10,000ft. Cypress was built from scratch in house with only rule-mandated recovery electronics and the rocket motor having been acquired off the shelf. After months of working late nights, a long roadtrip to New Mexico and final launch preparations in the Chihuahuan Desert, Cypresss successfully launched on June 24, 2017 at Spaceport America. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHUHS2hg2zs" target="_blank">The flight</a> went exceptionally well and secured our team a <strong>first place finish</strong> in the most competitive category of the competition.</p>

      <p>Within one year, UBC Rocket has grown to be the largest and most popular Engineering Design Team at UBC. The team is now 100 members strong, a significant growth from our 60 members last year. This year we are working on upgrades for Cypress, as well as three new rockets. In addition, we are conducting R&D towards a liquid-propellant rocket engine and appropriate test stand.</p>

      </div>

      <p>As part of the engineering physics summer program, I spent 6 weeks developing a robot full-time with a group of three friends. The robot competed in a competition between all second-year engineering physics students. The robot was built entirely from scratch by our team.</p>

      <p>The competition included a track that needed to be traversed, marked by a dark line. IR signals "locked" gates when oscillating at certain frequencies. Once at the end of the track, up to six small toys needed to be rescued from little platforms above a water bucket. Once rescued these pets had to be attached to a metal bar "zipline" to return to safety.</p>

      <p>I had multiple roles on the team. My primary task was to design, build and test the elevator and bucket mechanism used to store the rescued pets and bring them safely home (seen on right hand side of robot). I manufactured the parts using a laser cutter, 3D printers and a water jet cutter. A challenge we faced was accurately detecting when the robot is close to the zipline. To overcome this problem completely, I designed the elevator such that it can be raised and the robot simply needs to drive under the zipline and the bucket fall off passively and rolls to safety. No zipline detection required.</p>

      <p>Given my prior manufacturing experience, I also manufactured a large number of parts for all areas of the robot. Often an item would be designed by a team member and I would review and manufacture it, mostly using 3D printers and laser cutters.</p>

      <p>In addition, I made significant contributions to simplifying the internal configuration of the robot. I made the LCD display visible from the outside and added buttons and a potentiometer to allow for quickly adjusting robot settings when testing. This saved us many hours of having to open/close the robot panels.</p>

      <p>My final significant contribution to the project was on the software side. As the robot was close to its final form, I was responsible for extensively testing the robot on the practise track. Many subtle bugs came up which were systematically solved by exposing the robot to all possible test scenarios and failure modes.</p>

      <p>Led team of three students that built a laser transceiver capable of transmission rates of up to 0.7kB/s, close to the theoretically determined limit for the hardware used. The project led to an invitation for presentation at <a href="http://iemcon.org/">IEMCON 2016</a>.</p>

      <p>The device was built using an inexpensive laser emitter and a photodiode (combined price &#60;1$) and an Arduino. Initially, I built a prototype and tested the idea for feasibility which was successful. Following that, I built the actual devices and then wrote a custom communication protocol in C (Arduino Framework). The devices are able to automatically detect start-message and end-message signatures due to a predetermined baud rate agreed upon by both the sending and receiving device. It also includes robust error detection, such as the detection of interrupted messages and improper message encoding.</p>

      <p>Over the span of several weeks, I optimized the code to push the transmission rate close to the theoretical limit. Due to inherent delays in the Arduino code-base, I utilized the AVR language to optimize certain functions to speed them up for our use case. Furthermore, due to the fact that the device operates at a frequency much higher than what could be picked up by the human eye, I developed custom code to analyze test runs. The project involved many more challenges that were resolved by doing a lot of testing of the transceiver and carefully analyzing the test run data.</p>

      <p>As a user interface, we developed a Meteor app which serves as the chat server and provides a GUI (seen in image above). The chat was reliable over distances of up to 10m. Entire paragraphs could be sent in less than the blink of an eye. The source code is available on <a href="https://github.com/sbambey/DialUp" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.

      </div>
      <p>As part of the Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) Engineering Design Team at UBC, I developed the electronics and software and assisted with the mechanical build for an antenna tracker. The tracker software interfaces with the drone using a protocol called Mavlink and receives live telemetry. It then calculates a yaw and a pitch angle for the antenna and drives two stepper motors in the appropriate directions. The motors were initially controlled by two inexpensive stepper motor drivers that gave us some trouble. The team then received <a href="http://www.zaber.com/products/product_group.php?group=X-MCB2" target="_blank">a high-end stepper motor controller</a> which I integrated into the tracker. Feedback on the actual position of the antenna is provided by an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) mounted to the antenna plate. Working with the IMU has been a challenge, as drift in the output persists to be an issue. In the future, I am planning to replace the IMU with a mechanical feedback that does not have the drift issues.</p>

      <p>flightcrew.io is a job board that I developed in Ruby on Rails. It automatically matches pilots with jobs appropriate for their experience level. The project was mainly meant to be a way for me to learn proper web development skills, to be exciting to me personally and to provide value to some users. The functionality includes a detailed sign up system which allows users to enter their qualifications such as flight hours, licenses, ratings and more. A comprehensive matching algorithmn I developed, then matches pilots with jobs they are eligible for. Furthermore, I created an extensive back-end for adding and updating jobs on the site.</p>

      <p>A significant challenge was keeping up with a very large number of data sources (pilot job sources). To assist me, I developed automatic tasks that would update an internal database of all jobs and alert me when job pages had been updated. This would direct my attention and effort in the right places and allowed me to keep flightcrew.io up to date.</p>

      <p>The source code is available on <a href="https://github.com/sbambey/flightcrew" target="_blank">GitHub</a> and a live demo can be seen hosted on <a href="https://safe-forest-2459.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">Heroku</a> (may take a few seconds to load).</p>

      <p>manifest.space is a log of some of SpaceX's launches. It is a passion project for me and I occassionally find time to update it. The project is a Ruby on Rails app and is a great way for me to fiddle with different libraries and tools. In the early phases, I collaborated with some other people over the internet and as a result, I developed a basic revision tracking system available through the admin panel and integrated a markdown editor. The source code is available on <a href="https://github.com/sbambey/manifest" target="_blank">GitHub</a> and a live demo can be seen hosted on <a href="https://secret-sands-2898.herokuapp.com/providers/spacex/completed" target="_blank">Heroku</a> (may take a few seconds to load).</p>
